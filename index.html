        <h3>Life</h3>
        <p><span style="color: #7FFF00;">“If you want to be happy, set a goal that commands your thoughts, liberates your energy and inspires your hopes.” – Andrew Carnegie.</span> <br><br>

            When we are faced with difficult times as we are now with the effects of a worldwide pandemic, it is easy to get discouraged and lose hope.  Hope is a vital component of human existence, and it is needed to find happiness and peace during times that might otherwise lead us to be discouraged.  As Andrew Carnegie so clearly pointed out, setting a goal can keep your thoughts focused, direct your energy, and inspire the hope that is needed to move through and beyond a moment of despair. <br><br>
            
            <strong><span style="color: #7FFF00;"> Have you ever wondered why some people are so good at fulfilling their dreams and living a life of purpose? What is their "secret sauce" for success?</span></strong> <br><br>
            
            Some people would say that all you need to do is work hard to achieve what you want in life. Some people think it's about who you know or what you have.  Yet others feel there are those born with access and that they are given all the breaks in life.  The truth is, statistics demonstrate that those who create goals and have a regular and consistent goal-setting process are much more likely to achieve their life’s dreams. <br><br>
            
            Regardless of how hard you work, if you are aiming for the wrong dream, then all that effort will only get you to the wrong destination faster, and that would be extremely disappointing. <br><br>
            
            Despite connections, you still have to continuously demonstrate to everyone that you were worthy of receiving the opportunity in the first place.  Eventually, proving your worth to others becomes exhausting. <br><br>
            
            <strong> However, there is a formula for turning your dreams into reality, and it isn't dependent on who you know or proving yourself.  The formula is:</strong> <br><br>
            <span style="color: #FFD700;">
            Goals + commitment = Dreams come true
            </span><br><br>
            By having clear goals, you become aware of precisely what you want to achieve and how to go about doing it. You are able to more accurately assess and measure your ability to accomplish the goals and most importantly, you have a plan that can guide you along the way and keep you on track. <br><br>
            
            Add commitment and determination to your goals and you will find that you are willing to take continuous and consistent action toward making your dreams a reality, despite any obstacles in your path, including difficult times. <br><br>
            
            Having goals and staying committed to them will keep your focus on the things that you have identified as essential to reaching your desired outcomes.  Too often, we expend precious time on issues that have nothing to do with what we really want in our lives. We get distracted by focusing on what others are doing and achieving, and striving to do the same. <br><br>
            
            Having a vision and a supporting plan of what you want to achieve in life is necessary if you ever want to arrive at the correct destination. <br><br>
            
            We know that this is a very difficult time and staying focused during the COVID-19 pandemic can definitely be a challenge.  We also know that life will continue for the vast majority of people during and after this pandemic.  Now, more than ever, we believe that it is important to stay focused on something that can drive you through this difficult time.  Because of this, we’ve put together a Goal-Setting Guide to help you get on track to achieving goals and manifesting your life’s dreams. <br><br>
            
            That's why we are providing a Goal Setting Toolkit to help you identify your goals and create a plan to keep you on track. We hope that it will help motivate and encourage you to stay focused on your goals and develop a plan to reach your life’s dreams, even during this difficult time. <br><br>

        <h3>Personal Goal Setting</h3>
        <p><strong><span style="color: #7FFF00;">Planning to Live Your Life Your Way</span></strong><br><br>Many people feel as if they're adrift in the world. They work hard, but they don't seem to get anywhere worthwhile. <br><br>A key reason that they feel this way is that they haven't spent enough time thinking about what they want from life, and haven't set themselves formal goals. After all, would you set out on a major journey with no real idea of your destination? Probably not! <br><br>
        <strong><span style="color: #7FFF00;">How to Set a Goal</span></strong>
        <br><br>

        <span style="background-color: #620cd1e0;">First consider what you want to achieve, and then commit to it. Set SMART (specific, measureable, attainable, relevant and time-bound) goals that motivate you and write them down to make them feel tangible. Then plan the steps you must take to realize your goal, and cross off each one as you work through them.</span><br><br>
        
        Goal setting is a powerful process for thinking about your ideal future, and for motivating yourself to turn your vision of this future into reality. <br><br>

        The process of setting goals helps you choose where you want to go in life. By knowing precisely what you want to achieve, you know where you have to concentrate your efforts. You'll also quickly spot the distractions that can, so easily, lead you astray. <br><br>

        <strong><span style="color: #7FFF00;"><u>Setting Lifetime Goals</u></span></strong><br>

        The first step in setting personal goals is to consider what you want to achieve in your lifetime (or at least, by a significant and distant age in the future). Setting lifetime goals gives you the overall perspective that shapes all other aspects of your decision making. <br>

        To give a broad, balanced coverage of all important areas in your life, try to set goals in some of the following categories (or in other categories of your own, where these are important to you : <br><br>

        <strong>Career :</strong> What level do you want to reach in your career, or what do you want to achieve? <br><br>

        <strong>Financial :</strong> How much do you want to earn, by what stage? How is this related to your career goals? <br><br>

        <strong>Education :</strong>  Is there any knowledge you want to acquire in particular? What information and skills will you need to have in order to achieve other goals? <br><br>

        <strong>Family :</strong> Do you want to be a parent? If so, how are you going to be a good parent? How do you want to be seen by a partner or by members of your extended family? <br><br>

        <strong>Attitude :</strong>  Is any part of your mindset holding you back? Is there any part of the way that you behave that upsets you? (If so, set a goal to improve your behavior or find a solution to the problem. <br><br>

        <strong>Physical :</strong> Are there any athletic goals that you want to achieve, or do you want good health deep into old age? What steps are you going to take to achieve this? <br><br>

        <strong>Pleasure :</strong>  How do you want to enjoy yourself? (You should ensure that some of your life is for you! <br><br>

        <strong>Public Service :</strong> Do you want to make the world a better place? If so, how? <br><br>

        <strong><span style="color: #7FFF00;"><u>Setting Smaller Goals</u></span></strong><br><br>

        Once you have set your lifetime goals, set a five-year plan of smaller goals that you need to complete if you are to reach your lifetime plan. <br>

        Then create a one-year plan, six-month plan, and a one-month plan of progressively smaller goals that you should reach to achieve your lifetime goals. Each of these should be based on the previous plan. <br></br>

        Then create a daily <strong><span style="color: #7FFF00;">To-Do List </span></strong>  of things that you should do today to work towards your lifetime goals. <br><br>

        At an early stage, your smaller goals might be to read books and gather information on the achievement of your higher level goals. This will help you to improve the quality and realism of your goal setting. <br><br>

        Finally, review your plans, and make sure that they fit the way in which you want to live your life.
